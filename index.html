        <h1>Contemporary Furniture for an Urban Flat</h1>
        <p class="sub-heading">Choosing furniture can be hard as places like IKEA offer a wide array of
        styles, rooms and prices. As this is hard to navigate and choose from, this page
      shall serve as a collection of furniture to put in a lovely and modern new flat
      in the heart of Berlin.</p>

        <h1>The hub of excitement</h1>
        <p>The living room presents the place where all of your friends, family and yourself will
        come together to eat, drink, talk, play and enjoy yourselves. It is not only an oasis of comfort
        and soothing furniture but also invites anyone else to relax and take it the enjoyable atmosphere. <br><br>
        The sofabed will allow visitors to stay over and enjoy extra time with you, while also allowing you
        to have a stylish sofa when watching TV or reading. The industrial style lamp and specially framed side
        table also further complement the decor and add a certain flair to the room to make it more cosy. The
        relaxation chair allows you to rock back and forward while endulging yourself in a good book or surfing
        your tablet. <br><br> This furniture offers an amazing set of pieces that will complement any room and look lovely and inviting
        to any of its residents or visitors.</p>

        <h1>A soothing retreat</h1>
        <p>The bedroom allows you to retreat and find some peace and quiet among the outside buzz and lively
        neighbourhood. The bed bursts with plenty of storage to allow you to not only sleep in comfort but also
        not to worry about the tidbits lying around the room. The chair allows clothes that can't be stored
        in the spacious wardrobe to be put on there while deciding between outfits. The wardrobe also has plenty
        of storage to store his and her clothes safely and in an orderly fashion. The chest of drawers offers
        further storage for any item of clothing.</p>
